# Thuya CMS - Framework

Thuya CMS is an open-source headless CMS that I recently started to develop. The first version is still not released.
Creating guides about how to contribute to the code is in process.

## Summary of goals

I would like to create websites using custom frontend developed using various technologies. But implementing the backend usually requires a large effort, even for a simple website. I'm too lazy to learn using other CMS frameworks in detail but enthusiastic enough to start creating my own. 

So the goal would be to have a framework that is easy to use and learn. Not by reading long documentations about how to define the content using various JSON documents but using object oriented code.
